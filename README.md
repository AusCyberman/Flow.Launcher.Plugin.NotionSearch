# Notion search Flow Launcher plugin

This Flow Launcher plugin uses [notion-sdk-py](https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py.git) as the Python client to query pages and databases via the official Notion API. The plugin requires an integration token which can be obtained from [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations). The integration will need 'Read content' capabilities. Top level pages and databases will need to be shared with the integration for the plugin to work.

You can install this plugin via `pm install Notion Search`
