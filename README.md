# Notion search Flow Launcher plugin üîç

The Notion search plugin for [Flow Launcher](https://www.flowlauncher.com/) searches for pages and databases in a Notion workspace.

Install the plugin in Flow Launcher using the plugin manager hotkey, `pm install Notion Search`.

## Prerequisites

- ‚ö°[A Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/help/create-integrations-with-the-notion-api) and integration token.
- üëÄ The integration needs to be configured with read content permission.
- üîë The integration must be [added to at least one page in the Notion work space](https://notion.so/help/add-and-manage-integrations-with-the-api#add-integrations-to-pages) using the Share settings.

## Feature ideas

- Integrate semantic search to improve on keyword matching with [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack).
- Add context menu actions for querying databases, editing properties etc.
